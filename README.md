# toolboxes

Centralized repository of containers designed for Toolbox/Distrobox with batteries included. These toolboxes strive for:

* Instant launch
* Intended to be used as general purpose toolboxes for "daily driver" usage
* Can be used with [boxkit](https://github.com/ublue-os/boxkit) as base images to manage your own custom setup

## Images

* `debian-toolbox` - a Debian base image
* `fedora-toolbox` - a Fedora base image

It is strongly recommended that the [Ptyxis terminal](https://gitlab.gnome.org/chergert/ptyxis) be used with these toolboxes and is the default experience in both [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg) and [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io).
